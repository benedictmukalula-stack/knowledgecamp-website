Quick reference for human advisors when picking up from AI / WhatsApp / Web Chat.

## 1. Before You Message

1. Read the **AI summary** (2–3 lines at top of record).
2. Check key fields:
   - `lead_type`: individual / corporate
   - `urgency`: immediate / this_quarter / later
   - `decision_role`: decision_maker / influencer
   - `preferred_hub` or `city_or_online`
   - `category_interest` / `course_or_programme_name`
3. Glance at **deal size** and current **stage**.

## 2. Pick the Right Script

Use the suggested template name in GoHighLevel:

- Individual, new & urgent → **KC – WA – First Touch – Indiv**
- Corporate decision-maker → **KC – EM – First Touch – Corp-DM**
- Corporate influencer (needs approval) → **KC – EM – First Touch – Corp-Influencer**
- Individual clicked link but didn’t register → **KC – WA – Nudge – Indiv Registration**
- Corporate proposal waiting on approval → **KC – EM – Nudge – Corp Approval**
- Budget objection → **KC – WA – Objection – Price**
- Timing/capacity objection → **KC – WA – Objection – Timing**
- Individual ready to book → **KC – WA – Close – Indiv**
- Corporate programme accepted → **KC – EM – Close – Corp**

(If no template is suggested, choose the closest one from the list above.)

## 3. Personalise in 30 Seconds

When you open a template:

1. Check and update placeholders:
   - [First Name]
   - [Course Name] / [Course/Programme]
   - [City/Online]
   - [Date/Month]
   - [X delegates] / [Location(s)]
2. Add **one human detail** from the AI summary (their context, goal, or concern).
3. Keep the rest of the structure as-is so we stay consistent.

## 4. Your Goal in Each Message

Ask yourself: *“What is the one clear next step?”*

- New enquiry → clarify need and confirm best option.
- Proposal scenario → confirm whether to **send**, **adjust**, or **schedule**.
- Nudge → uncover the one thing blocking them (budget, timing, travel, approvals).
- Close → move to **registration link sent** or **dates confirmed**.

If you’re not sure, reply with a simple question like:

> "So that I can help you properly, what would you like to get done today – explore options, get a formal quote, or secure a specific date?"

## 5. When to Tag Objections

Use tags to keep CRM notes clean:

- If money is the issue → add **KC-Obj-Price** and use the Price script.
- If timing/capacity is the issue → add **KC-Obj-Timing** and use the Timing script.

This helps us learn over time what really blocks deals.

## 6. Quality Checklist (60 Seconds)

Before you move to the next lead:

- [ ] Did I **acknowledge** their context (from AI summary)?
- [ ] Did I **propose one clear next step**?
- [ ] Did I keep the tone **warm, concise, and professional**?
- [ ] Did I **update tags/stage** if anything changed (e.g. awaiting approval, ready to register)?

If yes, move on – don’t overthink. Let the workflows bring them back when it’s time to follow up.
